How to Send a Message on Slack Using a Python Script
Step 1: Create a Slack account. Visit: https://slack.com/intl/en-in

Step 2: Create a workspace, and then create a channel (channels can be either public or private).

Step 3: Go to api.slack.com, click on Your Apps, and create a new app.

Step 4: Enter the name of your app and select your workspace.

Step 5:

Navigate to OAuth & Permissions.

Scroll down to Scopes, and under Bot Token Scopes, add the required permission: chat:write.

A token will be generated for authentication. Add this token to your workspace.

These steps are sufficient if you're sending messages to a public channel.

Step 6:
To send a message to a private channel, you need to perform one additional step:

Under OAuth & Permissions, add the groups:read permission.

This allows the app to identify whether a channel is private or public. Without this permission, you may encounter the "channel not found" error.

Step 7:
Go to your Slack channel and type /invite @name_of_your_app to invite the app to the channel.
This step is required to avoid the "channel not found" error when sending messages.

Step 8:
Now open your messagebot.py file, and:

Paste your Slack token in the token variable.

Paste the URL in the url variable.

Paste the channel ID in the channel variable.

After completing all these steps, congratulations â€” your message will be successfully sent to your Slack channel!
