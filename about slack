# How to Send a Message on Slack Using a Python Script

## Step 1
Create a Slack account.  
Visit: [https://slack.com/intl/en-in](https://slack.com/intl/en-in)

## Step 2
Create a workspace, and then create a channel (channels can be either **public** or **private**).

## Step 3
Go to (https://api.slack.com), click on **Your Apps**, and create a new app.

## Step 4
Enter the name of your app and select your workspace.

## Step 5
- Navigate to **OAuth & Permissions**.
- Scroll down to **Scopes**, and under **Bot Token Scopes**, add the required permission: `chat:write`.
- A token will be generated for authentication. Add this token to your workspace.
- These steps are sufficient if you're sending messages to a **public** channel.

## Step 6
To send a message to a **private** channel, you need to do one additional step:
- Under **OAuth & Permissions**, add the `groups:read` permission.
- This allows the app to identify whether a channel is private or public.
- Without this permission, you may encounter the error: **channel not found**.

## Step 7
Go to your Slack channel and type the following to invite the app: /invite @name_of_your_app
This is required to avoid the **channel not found** error when sending messages.

## Step 8
Open `messagebot.py` file, and:
- Paste your Slack token in the `token` variable.
- Paste the request URL in the `url` variable.
- Paste the **channel ID** in the `channel` variable.

 **Congratulations!**  
After completing all these steps, your message will be successfully sent to your Slack channel!
